          NetDetect: A Centralized Network Monitoring System is designed to
          enhance the way institutions manage and secure their networks.
          Developed by researchers from CRMC-College of Computer Studies, the
          project offers cutting-edge solutions to ensure real-time monitoring,
          streamline device authorization, and evaluate network health. In an
          increasingly digital environment, a robust network infrastructure is
          essential, especially for educational institutions like schools.

            Collaborative Research Approach
          </h4>
          <p className="text-md text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
            The development of NetDetect is driven by collaboration and data
            collection. Interviews with technical personnel and relevant staff
            enable us to identify critical areas of concern in network
            management and security. By understanding these challenges, we aim
            to create a system tailored to meet the specific needs of
            institutions.

            Additionally, we invite administrators and staff to participate in
            user testing. Through their feedback, gathered via a structured
            questionnaire, we ensure the systemâ€™s effectiveness and usability
            for educational environments. Together, we aspire to make networks
            safer and more efficient.
